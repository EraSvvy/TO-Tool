# TO-Tool
PlayTrickster Bot Tool - Discontinued for the most part

This will probably be the release of it. I went and figured out the Game Structure and will start updating this to match so. 

Feel free to use it, break it, copy it, sauce it, toss it, whatever. 

Would love contributers <3

Dev is very bored and busy with lots of shit-code to offer.
